I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Chicago. My research focus was primarily on developing Fair Machine Learning and Responsible AI algorithms. I was very fortunate to have Prof. Brian Ziebart as my advisor.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of Machine Learning:

- Fair Machine Learning

- Responsible AI

- Deep Learning 

- Natural Language Processing
