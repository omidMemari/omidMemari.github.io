Hi!

My name is Omid Memarrast. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Chicago. My research focus was primarily on developing Fair and Robust Machine Learning and Responsible AI algorithms. I was very fortunate to have Prof. [Brian Ziebart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_JjIgGcAAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisor. I received my BS in Software Engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

Recently, I've got a keen interest in Generative AI models and how to make them more responsible and fair.


My resume is available [here](../files/Resume_Omid.pdf) (updated on Aug 2023)
