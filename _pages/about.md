I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Chicago. My research focus was primarily on developing Fair Machine Learning and Responsible AI algorithms. I was very fortunate to have Prof. Brian Ziebart as my advisor.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of Machine Learning. I am experienced in and passionate about:

Fair Machine Learning

Responsible Generative AI

Deep Learning 

Natural Language Processing
